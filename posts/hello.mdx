# Hello World!

Welcome to Userstack, the user-focused development stack for B2B SaaS. We exist to make the lives of SaaS builders better.

As software programming becomes more and more common, and product building becomes more and more popular, the pressure points of the process evolve and shift. Right now, some parts are insanely effortless. Leveraging recent AI developments, it's even possible to build a full user interface from a series of spoken prompts!

Some parts remain tricky, though. Some parts continue to take your attention and energy away from the core value you're trying to deliver to users.

Well, we're here to help. With the first version of Userstack, we're taking on the integration work you need to do when building business logic around subscriptions. Figuring out which user belongs to which team, and therefore which subscription? Done. Upgrading your customer's plan, and monitoring payments? Check. Automatically turning features on or off depending on your plan design? Booyah.

With Userstack it's a breeze, and it's collaborative too. Technical people and non-technical people are all invited to enjoy the benefits of *not* spending weeks on annoying, complex work that is totally outside of your core product value.

I'm looking forward to inviting you on the platform, and serving you on your journey to build a wonderful product.

Shane
