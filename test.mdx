# Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post. This is a test post to demonstrate how MDX works in a Next.js application. With MDX, you can write JSX directly in your markdown files, making it incredibly powerful for creating rich content.

## What is MDX?

MDX is a markdown format that allows you to use JSX within your markdown documents. This means you can use React components directly in your markdown, allowing for more interactive and dynamic blog posts.

### Example Component

Let's say we have a simple React component that displays a message:

```jsx
function Greeting({ message }) {
  return <strong>{message}</strong>;
}
```
